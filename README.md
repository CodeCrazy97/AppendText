# AppendText
This Python script will prompt the user to jot down the highlights from the previous week. 

When finished typing the events, the user presses the Enter key. Then, the program calculates the date of the Sunday for the previous week. For example, suppose I ran the program on July 16, 2019. The date of the Sunday for the previous week would be "July 7, 2019". (So, this date will only be correct if the program is ran during the week after the events. If I am recording events for the week of July 7 - July 13, 2019, the date part of the program would be correct only if the program is ran during the week of July 14 - July 20, 2019.) 

When finished, the program sends the text entered to a text file, putting __*** Week of XXX XX, XXXX ***__ above the events.
